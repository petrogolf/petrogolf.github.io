I am 27 years old and grew up in New Jersey, but currently reside in San Diego.  I moved here because of the beautiful weather and everything it has to offer.  I enjoy everything about golf, from playing 18 holes to teaching a beginner how to properly grip a club.  I believe that my passion for golf can help others enjoy this great game even more.\r\n\r\n### Want to Learn How to Golf?\r\nWhether you are an experienced golfer or are just picking up a golf club for the first time, I can help you play better and shoot lower scores.  There are many variables that go into shooting lower scores, and I am willing to analyze your game and come up with a solid plan to improve every aspect of it.\r\n### Qualifications\r\nI have been playing golf since I was 8 years old, including countless tournaments are the United States.
